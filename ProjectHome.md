A starter kit, framework, and collection of common code, libraries and utilities used to create ASP.NET/db4o applications.

SiteStarter is the basis of projects such as the WorkHub modular project organization application.

Depending on the needs of your project you can decide whether to:

  * Reference SiteStarter libraries and functionality directly, giving you ongoing access to updates and bug fixes with the least effort.
  * Create wrappers for all SiteStarter functionality to utilize functionality behind the scenes while simplifying and maximizing development capabilities.
  * Copy SiteStarter code into your projects and edit it to suit your requirements.
  * Look through SiteStarter code to get ideas, learn how it works, and apply new ideas your own projects.
  * Use each of the above approaches for different aspects of your project.

If you use SiteStarter code or libraries please:

  * Add credit within your project to the SiteStarter project and a link to SoftwareMonkeys.net
  * Send an email support@softwaremonkeys.net with a brief testimonial of how you utilize the SiteStarter project. (Testimonials may be made public unless requested otherwise.)

The following projects use the SiteStarter project:

  * WorkHub2 modular framework - Imports SiteStarter code using the Commander console.
